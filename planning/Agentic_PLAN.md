# System Architecture: The "Recruiter Brain"

The system is divided into three autonomous loops. Unlike a linear pipeline, these loops talk to each other.

1. **The Research Loop**: Defines what "Good" looks like.
2. **The Acquisition Loop**: Hunts for talent (Inbound + Outbound) and optimizes based on Resume Quality.
3. **The Interview Loop**: Validates talent using deep, forensic questioning and optimizes based on Interview Performance.

## Phase 0: Human Input Interface (The "Kickoff" Form)

> The only human touchpoint. Everything after this is autonomous.

This is the single form HR fills out to launch the entire recruiting machine. Designed for minimal effort, maximum context.

---

### Step 1: Required Inputs (The Essentials)

| Field | Type | Example | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| **Job Title** | Text | "AI Engineer (Entry Level)" | Core search term for research |
| **Location** | Dropdown + Multi-select | Dubai | Determines salary data, visa logic |
| **Company** | Auto-filled / Editable | "Printerpix" | For JD branding, competitor analysis |
| **Department** | Text | "Growth & AI Team" | Context for team fit |
| **Hiring Urgency** | Select | 🟡 30 days | Controls outbound aggressiveness |

---

### Step 2: System-Generated Suggestions (Human Reviews)

> After Step 1 is submitted, the system researches for ~60 seconds and returns suggestions.

#### 💰 Salary Range (Market-Calibrated)

The system scrapes current market data and suggests:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Suggested Salary Range (Dubai, Entry-Level 2026)  │
│                                                     │
│  Low:     AED 4,000/month   (Fresh graduate)       │
│  Market:  AED 6,500/month   (Graduate + projects)  │
│  High:    AED 10,000/month  (Internship exp)       │
│                                                     │
│  [ ] Use Low Rate                                  │
│  [ ] Use Market Rate                               │
│  [x] Custom: AED 5,000 - 10,000/month             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:** For entry-level, the range signals "we pay for proven potential." The system notes: *"Offering up to 10K attracts candidates with internship experience who might otherwise go to big tech."*

#### 🎯 Suggested Must-Have Skills (Editable)

Based on 2026 trends for "AI Engineer (Entry Level)":

```
Auto-detected (toggle on/off):
[x] Python
[x] JavaScript / TypeScript
[x] SQL / Databases (PostgreSQL, Supabase)
[x] API Integration (REST, working with AI APIs)
[ ] React / Next.js (nice-to-have)
[ ] Docker (nice-to-have for entry level)

+ Add custom skill: [Claude Code / Cursor IDE]
+ Add custom skill: [LLM Prompt Engineering]
```

#### 🏢 Target Companies (Internship Experience From)

```

[x] Talabat (delivery tech, data pipelines)
[x] Kitopi / Checkout.com (startup mentality)
[x] Any YC / Techstars startup (scrappy builders)
[ ] Big Tech internships (Google, Meta, Amazon)

Note: For entry-level, we're looking for internship experience
or significant personal projects at/with these companies.
```

---

### Step 3: Optional Requirements (Checkboxes)

> Legal/compliance filters that hard-reject candidates who don't qualify.

#### 📋 Work Authorization

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [x] **Visa Sponsorship Available** | Expands pool to fresh graduates needing sponsorship |
| [ ] **Must Have Valid Work Visa** | Triggers visa gatekeeper flow |
| [ ] **UAE National Only** | Strict filter for Emiratization roles |
| [ ] **GCC National Preferred** | Soft preference, not a hard filter |

#### 🔒 Security & Compliance

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [ ] **Security Clearance Required** | Adds screening question + background check flag |
| [ ] **NDA Required Before Interview** | Sends NDA for signature before interview link |
| [ ] **Background Check Consent** | Adds consent checkbox to interview flow |

#### 🎓 Education Requirements

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [x] **Bachelor's Degree Required** | CS, Engineering, or related field |
| [ ] **Master's/PhD Preferred** | Not required for entry level |
| [ ] **Specific Certifications** | Text field: *(none required)* |

#### 📍 Work Arrangement

| [ ] **Hybrid OK** | Accepts candidates open to hybrid |
| [ ] **Fully Remote OK** | Broadest pool |
| [ ] **Relocation Package Available** | Mentioned in JD, expands geographic search |

#### 📋 Pre-Screening Questions (Auto-sent Before Interview)

> These questions are sent to inbound candidates via email. For outbound candidates, requirements are embedded in the personalized outreach (see Phase 4).

| Question | Include? | Auto-reject if... |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| [x] **Visa/Work Authorization** | Yes | Needs sponsorship (when not offered) |
| [x] **Current Location** | Yes | Not in target location |
| [x] **Start Date Availability** | Yes | Can't start within urgency window |
| [x] **Minimum Commitment** | Yes | Won't commit to 12 months |
| [x] **On-site Confirmation** | Yes | Wants remote-only |
| [ ] **English Proficiency (1-5)** | Optional | Rating < 3 |
| [ ] **Graduation Status** | Optional | Not graduated (for entry-level) |
| [ ] **Salary Confirmation** | Optional | Hasn't reviewed posted range |

### Step 4: Company Context (The Secret Weapon)

> This is where you give the AI the "insider knowledge" to find truly relevant people.

**Note:** The **Ideal Candidate Profile** and **Red Flags** fields below are **auto-populated by the AI** based on market research from Step 2. The human can review, edit, or add to these suggestions based on insider knowledge the AI wouldn't have.

#### 🏗️ Project Context (Free Text)

```

│ "Building internal dashboards and agentic AI systems to 100x       │
│  performance across marketing channels. They'll use Claude Code,   │
│  Python, JavaScript, and databases to build full-stack apps        │
│  (backend + frontend). The role is highly results-oriented —       │
│  we don't want someone who builds systems mindlessly. They need    │
│  to understand HOW to use AI to achieve specific business          │
│  outcomes, measure impact, and iterate. Will work on automating    │
│  recruiting pipelines, marketing automation, and data dashboards." │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How this is used:**
- **JD Generation:** "You'll build AI-powered tools that 100x our marketing efficiency..."
- **Interview Questions:** "You have a marketing channel that converts at 2%. How would you approach using AI to improve this? What would you measure? Walk me through your thinking."
- **Resume Scoring:** Boosts candidates with project experience in automation, dashboards, AI integrations, or measurable outcomes.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How this is used:**
- **Resume Screening:** Auto-flags resumes with only academic experience; adds note "No industry exposure detected - likely reject unless exceptional projects"
- **Interview Questions:** "Show me something you built that people actually used. What was the outcome? Did it work?" and "Walk me through a time you used AI to solve a real problem, not a homework assignment."

## Phase 1: The Research & Strategy Engine (The Foundation)

> Before we look for people, we must master the domain.

### Agent 1: The Domain Architect (The "Professor")

**Trigger:** A new job title is input (e.g., "AI Engineer (Entry Level)").

**Action:** This agent performs deep web research to build a "Knowledge Graph" for this specific role.

- **Trend Analysis:** "What tools are entry-level AI engineers using in 2026?" (e.g., "Claude Code and Cursor IDE are becoming standard; prompt engineering is a must-have skill.")
- **Salary Calibration:** Scrapes salary data for Dubai entry-level roles to ensure competitive offers for top graduates.
- **Company Targeting:** Identifies which companies have strong internship programs producing quality talent (e.g., "Look for interns from Careem, Kitopi, or YC startups who shipped real features").

**Output:** A structured `Role_Strategy_Document` that guides all other agents.

---

### Agent 2: The Copywriter & SEO Specialist

**Action:** Drafts the Job Description (JD).

**Differentiation:** Instead of generic fluff, it injects "Filter Keywords" discovered by Agent 1. For entry-level roles, it emphasizes "Visa Sponsorship Available" and "Growth Opportunity" to attract ambitious graduates. It includes specific project context ("build AI systems that 100x marketing performance") to filter for results-oriented candidates.

**Output:** A published JD on Betterteam.

---

## Phase 2: The "Headhunter" Engine (Acquisition & Outbound)

> This is the aggressive top-of-funnel layer. It doesn't just wait for applicants; it goes to get them.

### Agent 3: The Outbound Hunter (The "Reed/LinkedIn" Bot)

**Goal:** Replicate your HR team's success on Reed.

**Action:**

1. **Search:** Uses the `Role_Strategy_Document` keywords to search resume databases (Reed, GitHub, specialized boards).
2. **Pre-Qualify:** It reads the profiles before contacting. If the match score is < 80%, it ignores them.
3. **Outreach:** It sends a hyper-personalized cold email with **screening requirements + interview link embedded** (see Phase 4 for details).
   - ❌ **Bad:** "We have a job."
   - ✅ **Good:** "I saw your repo on [Project X] and your work with [Tech Y]. We are building something similar..."
4. **Embedded Screening:** The email includes role requirements upfront (location, salary, visa, start date) so candidates self-filter before clicking.
5. **Direct CTA:** Interview link included in the email — **one click to interview** (no back-and-forth questionnaire for outbound candidates).

**Why One Email?** Outbound candidates are passive — every extra step loses ~30% of them. Embedding screening + interview in one email maximizes conversion.

---

### Agent 4: The Acquisition Manager (The Optimization Brain)

**The "Quality" Feedback Loop:** This agent monitors the pipeline daily.

#### Scenario A: The "Noise" Trap

- **Input:** High CTR on Betterteam, but Agent 5 (Screener) is rejecting 90% of resumes.
- **Decision:** "The JD is too broad/clickbaity."
- **Action:** Automatically triggers Agent 2 to rewrite the JD to be stricter, adding "Knockout Questions" or emphasizing hard requirements to deter unqualified applicants.

#### Scenario B: The "Ghost Town"

- **Input:** Low CTR, low volume.
- **Decision:** "We are invisible."
- **Action:** Triggers Agent 3 to increase daily outbound email volume and broadens the search keywords in Agent 1's strategy.

#### Scenario C: The "Gold Mine"

- **Input:** Low volume, but 80% of resumes are passing to the interview stage.
- **Action:** Do nothing. This is the ideal state. High efficiency.

---

## Phase 3: The Forensic Screener (Resume Analysis)

> Deep analysis before the interview invites go out.

### Agent 5: The Forensic Analyst

**Action:** Parses incoming resumes (Inbound) or scraped profiles (Outbound).

**The "BS Detector":** It checks for:

- **Timeline Logic:** "Did they really become a Senior VP in 1 year?"
- **Skill Clustering:** "They list React and Angular, but their project descriptions only mention jQuery. Flag for interview."

**Output:** A `Resume_Score` (0-100) and a `Suspicion_Report`.

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 70 | Auto-reject |
| ≥ 70 | Proceed to Pre-Screening |

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Screening Gatekeeper (The "Quick Filter")

> Before the AI interview, filter out candidates who don't meet basic logistical requirements.

This phase handles the **screening questionnaire** that filters candidates on non-negotiable criteria (visa, availability, commitment) before they enter the AI interview funnel.

### Why This Exists

Don't waste a 30-minute AI interview on someone who:
- Needs visa sponsorship when you can't provide it
- Can't start for 6 months when you need someone ASAP
- Wants remote when the role is on-site
- Has salary expectations 3x your budget

### Agent 6: The Gatekeeper

**Trigger:** Candidate passes resume screening (score ≥ 70).

**Action:** Sends a pre-screening questionnaire based on role requirements.

---

### Inbound Candidates (Applied via Job Board)

For candidates who applied through Betterteam/LinkedIn, send a **reply-based questionnaire email**:

**What Gets Auto-Rejected:**
- Employer/employment visa (needs sponsorship/labor transfer)
- Tourist/visit visa
- Can't commit to 12 months
- Remote-only when role is on-site
- Start date > 60 days when urgency is ASAP

### Outbound Candidates (Headhunted)

> For candidates YOU contacted first, **reduce friction** by embedding screening questions in the personalized outreach email.

**Key Insight:** When you cold-email someone, they're already skeptical. If you make them:
1. Reply to a screening email
2. Wait for another email with interview link
3. Then do the interview

...you'll lose 70% of them. Instead, **combine steps 1 + 2** into a single email.

```

**Why This Works:**
- **Self-filtering:** Candidates who don't meet requirements simply don't click
- **Lower friction:** One email → interview (not email → reply → email → interview)
- **Higher conversion:** Passive candidates respond better to direct CTAs
- **Clear expectations:** Salary, location, timeline upfront = no surprises later

**Flow:**
1. Outbound email sent with interview link → Status: `OUTBOUND_SENT`
2. If candidate clicks and starts interview → Status: `INTERVIEW_STARTED`
3. If no action in 7 days → Auto follow-up email
4. If no action in 14 days → Mark as `NO_RESPONSE` (can retry in 90 days)

### Screening Questions Are Dynamic

The questionnaire adapts based on `Job_Input_Document`:

| If Job Requires... | Question Added |
|--------------------|----------------|
| On-site work | "Role is on-site at [location]. Does this work for you?" |
| Visa sponsorship NOT available | "Do you have valid work authorization for [country]?" |
| Security clearance | "Are you willing to undergo a background check?" |
| Specific start date | "Can you start by [date]?" |
| Minimum commitment | "Can you commit to at least [X] months?" |

**Non-Dubai roles** may skip most questions and go straight to interview (configurable in Phase 0).

---

## Phase 5: The Investigator (The "Intentional" Interview)

> Here is where the "Heavy Research" focus shines. Every question has a purpose.

### Agent 7: The Interview Architect (The "Director")

**Trigger:** A candidate clicks their interview link (one-time use, available 24/7).

**Action:** This agent assembles a **personalized interview script** by pulling from 4 distinct sources:

---

#### Source 1: Role Research Questions (From Agent 1)

Questions based on market research and best practices for this specific role.

| Research Insight | Generated Question |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Vector databases are trending for AI roles in 2026" | "What's your experience with vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate? How would you decide when to use one?" |
| "Entry-level AI engineers often struggle with prompt engineering" | "Walk me through how you'd design a prompt for a complex task. What makes a prompt effective vs. ineffective?" |
| "Companies report that results-orientation is the #1 predictor of success" | "Tell me about a project where you had to measure success. What metrics did you choose and why?" |

**Source:** `Role_Strategy_Document` from Phase 1

---

#### Source 2: Company Context Questions (From Phase 0)

Questions tailored to the actual work they'll do at YOUR company.

| Company Context (Phase 0 Input) | Generated Question |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| "Building AI dashboards to 100x marketing performance" | "If I gave you a marketing funnel converting at 2%, how would you approach using AI to improve it? What would you measure first?" |
| "Will use Claude Code, Python, JS, databases" | "You need to build an internal tool that pulls data from an API, processes it, and displays it in a dashboard. Walk me through your approach — what stack would you use and why?" |
| "Results-oriented, not just building systems mindlessly" | "Tell me about a time you stopped mid-project because you realized the approach wasn't going to achieve the goal. What did you do?" |

**Source:** `project_description` from `Job_Input_Document`

---

#### Source 3: Resume-Specific Questions (Personalized Probes)

Questions that dig into THIS candidate's specific claims and experiences.

| Resume Claim | Generated Question | What We're Testing |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Built dashboard at Kitopi internship" | "Tell me about the Kitopi dashboard. How many users? What was the hardest technical challenge? How did you know it was successful?" | Did they actually build it, or just contribute? |
| "Proficient in Python" | "You list Python as a skill. What's the most complex thing you've built with it? Show me your thinking process." | Depth of knowledge vs. surface familiarity |
| "Reduced manual work by 4 hours/week" | "Walk me through exactly how you measured that 4-hour reduction. What was the before and after?" | Can they quantify impact or is it made up? |

**Source:** Parsed resume from Phase 3

---

#### Source 4: Red Flag Exploration Questions (From Suspicion Report)

Questions specifically designed to probe concerns identified during resume screening.

| Red Flag Detected | Exploration Question | Pass Signal | Fail Signal |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| "No internship/business experience" | "Your resume shows mostly academic projects. Tell me about a time you worked on something with real users or real stakes — not a class assignment." | Mentions freelance, open source, or personal project with users | Can only cite coursework |
| "Short tenure pattern" | "I see you had a few short stints. Walk me through what happened at [Company X] — why did you leave after 6 months?" | Clear explanation (company closed, contract ended, relocation) | Vague ("wasn't a good fit") or blames others |
| "Claims don't match timeline" | "You mention leading a team of 5 at [Startup], but LinkedIn shows you were there for 4 months as an intern. Help me understand that." | Clarifies (team lead for a sprint, not the whole time) | Doubles down on inflated claim |
| "AI skills listed but no projects shown" | "You mention AI/ML skills. Show me something you built with AI. Walk me through the prompt engineering or model selection." | Can demo or explain in detail | Theory only, no practical application |

| **High correlation (>0.7)** | Promote question to Priority 1; use for all similar roles |
| **Low correlation (<0.3)** | Demote or remove; log why (too easy? too vague? gaming-able?) |
| **Medium correlation** | Test variants; A/B test different phrasings |
| **New question type works** | Add to best practices for this role category |

#### Question Evolution Over Time

The system maintains a **Question Bank** that evolves:

| Version | Entry-Level AI Engineer Questions | Why Changed |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| v1.0 | "Rate your Python skills 1-10" | Initial |

### Agent 9: The Voice Interrogator (Gemini 2.0 + Deepgram)

**Action:** Conducts the interview using the personalized script from Agent 7.

**Key Behaviors:**

1. **Follows the Script Priority:** Asks Priority 1 questions first, adapts based on time
2. **Listens for Pass/Fail Signals:** Uses the answer key from Agent 7 to score in real-time
3. **Triggers Follow-ups:** If candidate gives vague answer, pushes for specifics
4. **Real-time Fact Checking:** If the candidate says "I increased revenue by 200%," the agent (equipped with search tools) quickly verifies if that company was actually public/successful during that time. If data conflicts, it asks:

> "That's interesting, because public reports show a downturn that year. Can you clarify?"

5. **Adaptive Probing:** If a red flag answer is concerning, spends more time there before moving on

---

### Agent 10: The Adjudicator

**Action:** Reviews the recording and transcript after the interview.

**The "Truth" Feedback Loop:**

- **Input:** Candidate had a great Resume Score (90) but failed the Technical Interview (Score 20).
- **Diagnosis:** "Paper Tiger." The resume keywords were right, but the skill was fake.
- **Action:** It updates the Forensic Analyst (Agent 5) rules: "Downgrade the weight of [specific certification] because it is not correlating with success."

**New: Question Feedback**

After each interview, Agent 10 also sends data to Agent 8 (Question Optimizer):

```json
{
  "candidate_id": "12345",
  "questions_asked": [
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a project with real users",
      "response_quality": "strong",
      "pass_signals_detected": ["specific metrics", "ownership language"],
      "time_spent": "3 min"
    },
    {
      "question": "Rate your Python skills",
      "response_quality": "weak",
      "pass_signals_detected": [],
      "note": "Said '8/10' but couldn't explain anything complex"
    }
  ],
  "final_recommendation": "advance",
  "90_day_outcome": null  // Filled in later if hired
}
```

## Phase 6: Human Handoff (The "Decision Package")

> AI filters. Humans decide. This is where the hiring manager gets involved.

The AI's job is to **reduce the pile from 500 applicants to 5-10 finalists**. The human's job is to make the final call. This section defines exactly what HR/Hiring Manager receives and what actions they can take.

### What the Human Receives: The Candidate Dossier

After a candidate passes both AI interviews (Round 1: Behavioral, Round 2: Technical), the system generates a **Candidate Dossier** — a single-page summary designed for fast human decision-making.

### Human Decision Actions

| Action | What Happens | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **✅ ADVANCE** | Candidate moves to "Human Interview" stage. Calendar invite sent. | You want to meet them in person/video |
| **⏸️ HOLD** | Candidate stays in pipeline but deprioritized. No action taken. | "Maybe later" — waiting for other candidates |
| **❌ REJECT** | Polite rejection email sent. Candidate archived. | Clear no — doesn't meet bar |
| **💬 NOTE** | Add private notes visible only to hiring team | "Check if salary expectations align" |

---

### The Feedback Loop: Human Decisions Train the AI

> Every human decision makes the AI smarter.

#### When Human Advances a Candidate

The AI learns: "This profile pattern → success." It slightly upweights similar candidates in future scoring.

#### When Human Rejects a Candidate (with reason)

The AI learns from the WHY:

| Human Reason | AI Learning |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Too junior for this role" | Adjust experience weighting for this job level |
| "Salary expectations too high" | Flag similar profiles earlier with salary warning |
| "Bad culture fit (arrogant)" | Increase weight of humility signals in Round 1 |
| "Liked them but going with someone else" | No negative signal — competitive loss, not quality issue |

#### When Human Hires a Candidate

**This is gold data.** The AI now has a confirmed "good hire" signal. After 90 days, the system can:
- Check: Did this hire succeed? (Still employed? Promoted? Manager feedback?)
- If YES: Reinforce the pattern
- If NO: Investigate what signals were missed

### Dashboard View: The "Finalist Queue"

HR sees all candidates who passed AI interviews in a ranked queue:

```

**Notes on Rankings:**
- **⭐ Strong Hire:** All scores ≥75, no red flags
- **✓ Good:** Solid candidate, minor concerns
- **⚠️ Mixed:** High variance in scores (e.g., great resume, weak interview) — needs human judgment
- **⚠️ Borderline:** Just barely passed thresholds — review carefully

---

### Final Handoff: The Offer Stage

Once human decides to hire:

1. **AI generates offer letter draft** based on:
   - Salary range from `Job_Input_Document`
   - Candidate's location/visa needs
   - Standard company templates

2. **Human reviews and sends offer**

3. **System tracks:**
   - Offer sent date
   - Candidate response (accepted/declined/negotiating)
   - If declined: captures reason for future salary calibration

4. **On acceptance:**
   - Candidate marked as "HIRED"
   - Triggers onboarding workflow (outside this system's scope)
   - 90-day check scheduled for feedback loop

---

### Human Touchpoints Summary

| Phase | Human Action | Time Required |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Phase 0** | Fill kickoff form | ~5 min |
| **Phase 1** | Approve JD draft | ~2 min |
| **Phase 6** | Review finalist dossiers | ~5 min per candidate |
| **Phase 6** | Conduct final interview (optional) | ~30 min per candidate |
| **Phase 6** | Make hire decision | ~1 min |
| **Offer** | Review and send offer | ~5 min |

**Total human time for one hire:** ~1-2 hours (vs. 20+ hours in traditional process)

---

## Summary of the "Smart" Loops

| Loop Name | Trigger | Action | Goal |
|-----------|---------|--------|------|
| **The "Noise" Loop** | High Volume, Low Resume Scores | Rewrite JD to be harder/stricter | Reduce HR workload |
| **The "Reach" Loop** | Low Volume, High Resume Scores | Increase Outbound email limits; Broaden ad spend | Scale what works |
| **The "Liar" Loop** | High Resume Score, Low Interview Score | Tighten Resume Screening prompt; flag specific keywords as "suspect" | Catch fakes earlier |
