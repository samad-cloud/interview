Analyze 5-8 competitor job descriptions and produce a structured report:

1. **Common Phrases to AVOID** — List the generic, overused phrases you see repeated across multiple JDs (e.g., "fast-paced environment", "competitive salary", "make an impact", "career progression is actively supported"). These are noise that every company uses.

2. **Growth & Career Gaps** — How do competitors describe growth? Flag which ones are vague ("career growth opportunities") vs. specific ("Junior to Senior in 18 months", "mentorship from Staff Engineers"). Most will be vague — note that.

3. **What Top JDs Do Differently** — Identify 2-3 standout JDs that are genuinely compelling. What makes them different? (Specific projects mentioned? Named technologies with context? Clear team structure? Honest about challenges?)

4. **Salary Positioning** — How does "${params.salary}" compare to what competitors are offering for this role in this market?

5. **Missing Differentiators** — What do NONE of the competitor JDs mention that a smart candidate would actually care about? (Team size, who they report to, first-90-days plan, what success looks like, tech stack specifics, mentorship structure)

Be specific. Quote actual phrases you find. Name patterns.`,

  // Step 2: Generate the JD using research insights
  const jobDescriptionSchema = z.object({
    jobDescription: z.string().describe('The complete job description in clean Markdown format. No preamble, no commentary — only the JD itself.'),

    prompt: `You are an elite Technical Recruiter who writes JDs that top candidates actually respond to. You have just received competitor intelligence for this role. Use it to write a JD that is CLEARLY better than what's out there.

CORE DETAILS:
- Job Title: ${params.title}
- Location: ${params.location}
- Salary: ${params.salary}${additionalContext}

COMPETITOR RESEARCH (use this to differentiate):
${competitorResearch}

ANTI-GENERIC RULES — These are NON-NEGOTIABLE:
1. **No hollow growth promises.** Don't say "career progression is actively supported." Instead, describe the ACTUAL path: who they learn from, what they'll own in 3/6/12 months, what the promotion ladder looks like. If mentorship exists, name the structure (weekly 1:1s with a senior engineer? Pair programming? Code reviews?). If this is a solo role, be HONEST — "You'll be the founding AI engineer, building the function from scratch" is more compelling than fake mentorship promises.

2. **No vague impact claims.** Don't say "make a significant impact." Instead, describe WHAT they are building and WHY it matters. "You'll build agentic AI workflows that automate recruiting for 500+ hires/year" beats "make an impact on our AI initiatives." Be concrete about the problem, the scale, and why it's hard.

3. **No buzzword salads.** Every requirement must connect to actual work. Don't list "Python" — say "Python (you'll build data pipelines that process 10K+ resumes/month)." Don't list "communication skills" — say "You'll present technical proposals to non-technical leadership weekly."

4. **Differentiate from competitors.** You have the research above. Whatever phrases EVERY competitor uses — don't use them. Find a different angle. If every JD says "collaborative team," describe the team instead (size, backgrounds, what they shipped recently).

5. **Honest > Aspirational.** Candidates trust JDs that acknowledge trade-offs. "We're a 15-person team — you'll wear multiple hats but ship fast" is more believable than "world-class engineering organization."

6. **First 90 Days.** Include a "Your First 90 Days" section — what will they actually DO? Week 1, Month 1, Month 3. This is what competitors don't do and candidates love.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Return ONLY the job description. No introductory text, no commentary, no "here is the JD" preamble.
- Use clean Markdown (## for headers, - for bullets).
- Sections: Role Summary (2-3 punchy sentences, not a paragraph), What You'll Build (specific projects/problems), Your First 90 Days, What We're Looking For (requirements with context for each), Nice-to-Have, Why This Role (not generic "why join us" — why THIS specific role is a good career move right now).
- Tone: Direct, honest, specific. Write like you're talking to a smart person, not filing a corporate form.
- Keep it concise but thorough.`,
